## Crypto++ PEM Pack

This repository contains PEM parsing files for Wei Dai's Crypto++ (https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp). The source files allow you to read and write keys and parameters in PEM format. The files are officialy unsupported, so use it at your own risk.

There is a wiki page available at [PEM Pack](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/PEM_Pack).
